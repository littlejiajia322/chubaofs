## Overview

ChubaoFS (储宝文件系统 in Chinese) is a distributed filesystem (and object storage as well) for cloud native applications. It has the following features:

- scale-out metadata management

- strong replication consistency for both append and random write

- specific storage optimizations for large and small files

- multi-tenancy

- POSIX-compatible & mountable

- S3-like object storage interface

In particular, ChubaoFS can be used to decouple computing from storage for online applications, database or data processing services and machine learning jobs orchestrated by Kubernetes.

## Build

Build latest version of chubaofs is simply as following:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/chubaofs/chubaofs.git
$ cd chubaofs
$ make
```

If the build is successful, `cfs-server` and `cfs-client` will be found in directory `build/bin`

## Docker

Under the docker directory, a helper tool called run_docker.sh is provided to run ChubaoFS with docker-compose.

To start a minimal ChubaoFS cluster from scratch, note that **/data/disk** is arbitrary, and make sure there are at least 10G available space.

```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -r -d /data/disk
```

If client starts successfully, use `mount` command in client docker shell to check mount status:

```
$ mount | grep chubaofs
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in browser, login with `admin/123456` to view grafana monitor metrics.

Or run server and client seperately by following commands:

```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -b
$ docker/run_docker.sh -s -d /data/disk
$ docker/run_docker.sh -c
$ docker/run_docker.sh -m
```

For more usage:

```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -h
```
